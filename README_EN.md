ðŸ“„ **VersÃ£o em portuguÃªs**: [README.md](README.md)  

**React Tesseract** is a web application that allows users to upload images, extract text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) powered by **Tesseract.js**, and copy the extracted text to the clipboard.  
It is built with **React**, **Material-UI (MUI)**, and **i18n** support, now enhanced with **custom theme tokens**, **light/dark/system theme support**, and several UI/UX refinements.

---

## ðŸš€ Recent Updates
- Expanded the **pool of extractable items** for broader testing and flexibility.
- **Complete project rebranding** with a new visual identity.
- **Improved theme system**:
  - Supports **light**, **dark**, and **system** modes.
  - Organized tokens with custom colors (`palette.common`, `palette.custom`).
  - Added a dedicated `text.button` token for button text color customization.
- **UI refinements** for better contrast and responsiveness.
- Enhanced **i18n integration** for more accurate context translations.
- Improved **visual consistency** for buttons, cards, and modals.
- Integrated with **SonarCloud** for continuous code quality and security analysis.
