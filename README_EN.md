React Tesseract is a web application project that allows users to upload images, extract text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Tesseract.js, and copy the extracted text to the clipboard. The application is built using React and Material-UI, with support for light and dark themes.

## Description

The idea for this project came as an opportunity to study the Tesseract.js library and its OCR capabilities. Additionally, it was motivated by the need to avoid manually typing some texts and invoices, and the concern that online converters might be using the information for other purposes. With this application, you can perform text extraction securely and efficiently directly in your browser.

## Usage

- Access the application on Vercel: [tesseract](https://react-tesseract-fonteeboa.vercel.app)
- Upload an image by clicking the "Upload and Convert" button.
- Wait while the text is extracted from the image.
- The extracted text will be displayed on the screen.
- Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the extracted text to the clipboard.
- Use the theme toggle button to switch between light and dark themes.

## Tests

The tests are written using Jest and Testing Library. They cover the main components and services to ensure the application works correctly.
